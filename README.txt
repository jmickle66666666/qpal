QPALCONVERT
===========

Convert between quake palette files and png, to create new cool palettes for quake

Open up `palette.png` in your favourite image editor, and modify it however you'd like. Change the constrast/saturation etc for cool effects and then save it. (You can save it as any file)

In the commandline you can type `qpalconvert my_new_palette.png` and it will output `palette.lmp`, which can be used in your quake mod. Place it in the folder `my_quake_mod/gfx/` folder.

You can also just drag and drop your image onto `qpalconvert.exe` and it will work without having to use the commandline.



To use the new palette in your mod, place it in your mod folder at `your_mod/gfx/palette.lmp`
